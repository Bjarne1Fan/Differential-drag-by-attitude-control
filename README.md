## Differential drag control via attitude control

In short, this repository contains all a differential drag simulator in simulink, control laws for satellite foramtion flight and several necessary helper funtion.
The simulink simulator developed in this project can be found in the main simulink file system_model.slx.   

To run the Simulator, the matlab files main_setup.m, control.m and attitude.m must be run, which defines constants and initial values used for the differential drag control.

Further documentation will be avavailible sometime after the summer break :)
